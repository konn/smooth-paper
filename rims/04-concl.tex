\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}
We presented a succinct and efficient implementation of a multivariate lazy forward-mode tower automatic differentiation.
This can be viewed as a mixture of existing methods but optimised exploiting the commutativity of partial differential operators.
The basic idea is to store all the partial derivatives in some kind of a prefix-tree, in which the number of branching will eventually decrease as the right branch is chosen.
We applied laziness and the advanced type-system in Haskell.

Our implementation performs particularly well in multivariate cases and gives pleasing improvements both in time and space when applied to Weil algebra computation as described in \cite{Ishii:2021vw}.
For univariate case, however, there is much room for improvements.
It might be a good future work to explore the special treatment in the univariate case to remove overheads.
