@inproceedings{Elliott:2018aa,
	abstract = {Automatic differentiation (AD) in reverse mode (RAD) is a central component of deep learning and other uses of large-scale optimization. Commonly used RAD algorithms such as backpropagation, however, are complex and stateful, hindering deep understanding, improvement, and parallel execution. This paper develops a simple, generalized AD algorithm calculated from a simple, natural specification. The general algorithm is then specialized by varying the representation of derivatives. In particular, applying well-known constructions to a naive representation yields two RAD algorithms that are far simpler than previously known. In contrast to commonly used RAD implementations, the algorithms defined here involve no graphs, tapes, variables, partial derivatives, or mutation. They are inherently parallel-friendly, correct by construction, and usable directly from an existing programming language with no need for new data types or programming style, thanks to use of an AD-agnostic compiler plugin.},

@article{Nishimura:2007aa,
	abstract = {Synthetic differential geometry occupies a unique position in topos-theoretic physics. Nevertheless it has appeared somewhat too conceptual to physicists in general, partly because it has appeared to lack computational aspects. Its computational facets are really concerned with computation of the quasi-colimit of a finite diagram of infinitesimal spaces, or equivalently, with computation of the limit of a finite diagram of Weil algebras. Indeed we have been forced to do a highly involved computation of the above kind by hand in our previous papers (Nishimura, H. in Int. J. Theor. Phys. 36:1099--1131, 1997 and Nishimura, H. in Int. J. Theor. Phys. 38:2163--2174, 1999). The principal objective in this paper is to show that Gr{\"o}bner bases techniques provide us with means that relegate such computations to computers.},
