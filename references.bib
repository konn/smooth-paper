@article{Nishimura:2007aa,
	abstract = {Synthetic differential geometry occupies a unique position in topos-theoretic physics. Nevertheless it has appeared somewhat too conceptual to physicists in general, partly because it has appeared to lack computational aspects. Its computational facets are really concerned with computation of the quasi-colimit of a finite diagram of infinitesimal spaces, or equivalently, with computation of the limit of a finite diagram of Weil algebras. Indeed we have been forced to do a highly involved computation of the above kind by hand in our previous papers (Nishimura, H. in Int. J. Theor. Phys. 36:1099--1131, 1997 and Nishimura, H. in Int. J. Theor. Phys. 38:2163--2174, 1999). The principal objective in this paper is to show that Gr{\"o}bner bases techniques provide us with means that relegate such computations to computers.},
